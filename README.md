JavaFXWorkshop
==============

1. What is JavaFX and why should you care?
---------------
- successor of Swing
- Swing is dead! (Zombie-mode because for the time being it will be in the SDK)
- much more features like CSS-styling, rendering using graphic chip, binding, ...

2. Let's code!
--------------

Setup your tools:
- Eclipse IDE
- Eclipse project with Java >1.7u9 (with jfxrt.jar)
- SceneBuilder 1.1 (2.0 is still buggy) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/index.html)

1. SceneBuilder and fxml-files
2. Properties
3. Charts - the pie chart
4. Styling with CSS

That is what we will build:

More tools:
- Scenic View  (http://fxexperience.com/scenic-view/)
- e(fx)clipse (http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/index.html)


3. Swing Interop
----------------
- JavaFX in Swing easy. Swing in JavaFX not before JDK 8 (however possible)
- replace Swing components with FX components step by step
- maybe invert life cycle by setting a controller factory in FXML loader
- because of time constraints and focus of this workshop: Let's talk about that later and specific for your project.

4. current state of JavaFX (Java 1.7)
-------------------------------------
- Ensemble (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
- some basic components missing like date chooser
- some rough edges in the API
- huge hype with a lot of potential

5. future prospects
--------------------
- again a big leap forward in Java 1.8
